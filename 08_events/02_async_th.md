JavaScript 
    `synchronous(code execute one by one)
    `Single threaded(every thing will be executed in a single thread)

    That was the default javascript behavior
Execution Context 
    `execute one line of code at a time
    `console log 1
    `console log 2
    *Each operation waits for the previous one to complete

(Call stack)       (Memory heap)  


Blocking code
    `Block the flow of the diagram
    `Read file sync

Non blocking code
    `Donot block the execution
    `Read file async
